# Student Management System (C Language with DSA)

This project is a **Student Management System** implemented in **C**, utilizing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of student records. The system provides a **binary search tree (BST)** for managing student data, ensuring optimized searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## ✨ Features
- **Student Registration**: Add and update student records.
- **Course Management**: Assign and manage student courses.
- **Search Functionality**: Retrieve student details using an efficient BST.
- **Deletion & Update**: Modify or remove student records dynamically.
- **In-order Display**: View all student records in sorted order.

## 📂 Data Structures Used
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient searching and management of student records.
- **Arrays**: Store courses for each student.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C Language**
- **DSA Concepts (BST, Arrays, Pointers)**
- **File Handling (optional for persistence)**

## 🚀 Usage
Compile and run using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
```sh
gcc student_management.c -o student_management
./student_management
```

This system serves as a practical implementation of **DSA in C** and can be expanded for **file storage, GUI integration, or additional functionalities**.
